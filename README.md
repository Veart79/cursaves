Cursor stores chats locally. Switch machines and they're gone. This tool saves your chats to a git repo so you can restore them anywhere — or copy them between workspaces on the same machine.

## How It Works

### Terminology

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Chat** | A conversation with the AI in Cursor |
| **Workspace** | Cursor creates one for each directory you open. Chats belong to workspaces. |
| **Project ID** | How cursaves groups snapshots - based on git remote URL or directory name |
| **Snapshot** | An exported chat saved to `~/.cursaves/snapshots/<project-id>/` |

### Chat → Workspace → Project Mapping

**Cursor stores chats per workspace (per directory path):**

```
/Users/alice/repos/myapp     → Workspace A → [chat1, chat2, chat3]
/Users/bob/repos/myapp       → Workspace B → [chat4, chat5]
ssh://core/home/user/myapp   → Workspace C → [chat6, chat7]
```

Each workspace is a unique path. Even the same repo cloned to different locations creates separate workspaces with separate chats.

**cursaves groups snapshots by project identifier (git remote URL):**

```
All three workspaces above have the same git remote:
  git@github.com:user/myapp.git

So all their chats get saved to:
  ~/.cursaves/snapshots/github.com-user-myapp/
```

**On import, cursaves matches snapshots to local workspaces by path:**

```
Machine A exports chat from: /Users/alice/repos/myapp
Machine B imports chat into: /Users/bob/repos/myapp  (same project ID, different path)
  → Paths in chat metadata are rewritten automatically
```

This means you can sync chats for the same repo across different machines, even if the local paths differ.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install globally (once per machine)
uv tool install git+https://github.com/Veart79/cursaves.git

# Initialize the sync repo (once per machine)
cursaves init --remote git@github.com:you/my-cursaves.git
```

Then from any project directory:

```bash
# Save all conversations and push to remote
cursaves push

# On another machine: pull and restore conversations
cursaves pull
# Then restart Cursor (quit and reopen) to see the imported chats
```

For SSH remote projects, Cursor stores chats on your local machine. Use `-w` to target a workspace:

```bash
# See all workspaces (local + SSH remote)
cursaves workspaces

# Push/pull a specific workspace by number
cursaves push -w 3
```

`push` checkpoints your conversations, commits, and pushes to git. `pull` fetches from git and imports into Cursor's database. After importing, restart Cursor (quit and reopen) to see the conversations.

### Example

```
$ cursaves push

Checkpointing conversations for /Users/you/Projects/my-app...
  3 conversation(s) checkpointed
  Committed
  Pushing... done

Done. 3 conversation(s) saved and pushed.
```

```
$ cursaves list

## Installation

**Requirements:** Python 3.10+, [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), macOS or Linux, Git. Zero external Python dependencies.

**Tested with:** Cursor 2.6.11

### Install as a global CLI tool (recommended)

```bash
uv tool install git+https://github.com/Veart79/cursaves.git
```

This puts `cursaves` on your PATH so you can run it from any directory. Run this on each machine you want to sync between.

If `~/.local/bin` is not on your PATH, run `uv tool update-shell` or add it manually.

### Update

```bash
uv tool upgrade cursaves
```

### Alternative: clone and run locally

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Veart79/cursaves.git
cd cursaves
uv sync
uv run cursaves <command>

# Or without uv:
python -m cursor_saves <command>
```

## Setup

`cursaves` stores conversation snapshots in a local git repo at `~/.cursaves/`. To sync between machines, you point this at a remote repository.

### 1. Create a private repo for your checkpoints

Go to GitHub (or GitLab, etc.) and create a **new private repository**. This is where your conversation data will be stored -- keep it private since snapshots contain your full chat history, file paths, and machine info.

For example: `github.com/you/cursaves-data` (private).

Don't add a README or any files -- leave it completely empty.

### 2. Initialize on each machine

```bash
cursaves init --remote git@github.com:you/cursaves-data.git
```

This creates `~/.cursaves/` with a git repo, a `snapshots/` directory, and the remote configured. Run this once on every machine you want to sync between.

If you only want local checkpoints (no syncing), just run `cursaves init` without `--remote`. You can add a remote later with `cd ~/.cursaves && git remote add origin <url>`.

### 3. Start syncing

```bash
# From any project directory:
cursaves push              # checkpoint + commit + push
cursaves pull              # pull + import into Cursor's database
# Then restart Cursor to see the imported conversations
```

The first `push` will create the initial commit on the remote. After that, `push` and `pull` keep everything in sync.

## Commands

All commands default to the current working directory as the project path. Use `-w <number>` to target a workspace by number (from `cursaves workspaces`), or `-p /path` to specify a path directly.

| Command | Description | Modifies Cursor data? |
|---------|-------------|----------------------|
| **`push`** | **Checkpoint + commit + push (the main command)** | No |
| **`push -s`** | **Interactively select which conversations to push** | No |
| **`pull`** | **Git pull + import snapshots** | Yes |
| **`move`** | **Move chats after renaming/moving a project directory** | Yes |
| `init` | Initialize the sync repo at ~/.cursaves/ | No |
| `workspaces` | List all Cursor workspaces (local + SSH remote) | No |
| `list` | Show conversations for a project | No |
| `status` | Compare local conversations vs snapshots | No |
| `copy` | Copy chats between workspaces (same machine) | Yes |
| `delete` | Delete cached snapshots (interactive, by ID, or all) | No |
| `export <id>` | Export one conversation to a snapshot | No |
| `checkpoint` | Export all conversations (no git) | No |
| `import --all` | Import snapshots (no git) | Yes |
| `watch` | Auto-checkpoint and sync in the background | No (reads only) |

Most of the time you only need `push` and `pull`. Use `push -s` when you want to push only specific conversations instead of everything. Use `delete` to clean up snapshots you no longer need.

### Auto-sync with `watch`

```bash
# Run in a terminal on each machine -- handles everything automatically
cursaves watch -p /path/to/your/project

# Options
cursaves watch --interval 30     # check every 30s (default: 60)
cursaves watch --no-git          # checkpoint only, no git push/pull
cursaves watch --verbose         # log every check, not just changes
```

The watch daemon polls for database changes, auto-checkpoints when conversations update, and commits + pushes to git. On the other end, it pulls and picks up new snapshots.

## How Cursor Stores Chat Data

Cursor stores conversations in two local SQLite databases, not as files you can easily copy:

- **Workspace DB** (`workspaceStorage/{id}/state.vscdb`): A list of conversation IDs and sidebar metadata for each project. This is what populates the chat list in the sidebar.
- **Global DB** (`globalStorage/state.vscdb`): The actual conversation content -- one JSON blob per conversation, keyed by `composerData:{UUID}`.

Data locations:
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Cursor/User/`
- Linux: `~/.config/Cursor/User/`

Notably, **chat data is always stored on the machine running Cursor's UI**, even when connected to a remote host via SSH. This is why switching machines means losing your conversation context.

For more details, see [docs/how-cursor-stores-chats.md](docs/how-cursor-stores-chats.md).

## Cross-Platform Support

### Project identity

Projects are identified by their **git remote origin URL**, not the local directory name. This means:

- `~/Projects/bob` and `~/repos/alice` with the same `origin` are treated as the same project -- conversations sync between them.
- Two unrelated repos both named `myapp` won't collide, because their remotes differ.
- Non-git directories fall back to matching by directory name.

You can see what identity is being used with `cursaves status`.

### Path rewriting

When importing conversations on a different machine, absolute file paths in conversation metadata (e.g., which files were attached as context) are automatically rewritten to match the target project path. The actual conversation content -- your messages and AI responses -- is fully portable with no modification.

For example, a conversation started on macOS at `/Users/you/Projects/myapp` will have its file references rewritten to `/home/you/repos/myapp` when imported on a Linux machine.

## Restarting Cursor After Import

Cursor caches all conversation data in memory at startup and never watches its SQLite files for external changes. After `pull` or `import` writes new conversations to the database, **you must fully restart Cursor** (quit and reopen) to see the imported conversations.

Note: "Developer: Reload Window" is not sufficient -- it reloads the renderer but doesn't re-read the conversation database. A full application restart is required.

## Safety

- **Read operations** (`list`, `export`, `checkpoint`, `status`, `watch`) work on a temporary copy of the database. They never touch Cursor's files and are safe to run while Cursor is open.
- **Write operations** (`import`, `pull`) back up the target database before writing, and refuse to run while Cursor is detected as running. Use `--force` to override (not recommended).
- Snapshots are self-contained JSON -- even if import goes wrong, you always have the raw data and the backup.

## Privacy Warning

Snapshot files contain your **full conversation data**: your prompts, AI responses, file paths from your machine, your machine's hostname, and timestamps.

**Use a private repository** for the `~/.cursaves/` remote. Do not push conversation snapshots to a public repo.

## Typical Workflows

### Local projects

```bash
# On Machine A -- before switching, from your project directory:
cursaves push

# On Machine B -- after switching, from your project directory:
cursaves pull
# Then restart Cursor (quit and reopen) to see the imported conversations
```

### Copying chats between workspaces (same machine)

Cursor isolates chats per workspace. If you clone the same repo to a new directory, or open it from a different path, your previous chats won't be there. `cursaves` can copy them across:

```bash
# Export chats from the old workspace
cd /path/to/old/checkout
cursaves push

# Import into the new workspace
cd /path/to/new/checkout
cursaves pull
# Restart Cursor to see the imported chats
```

This also works with `-s` to selectively pick which conversations to copy, and with `-w` to target specific workspaces without `cd`-ing into them.

No remote repo is needed for this — `cursaves init` (without `--remote`) is enough for local-only use.

### Moving chats after renaming a project directory

Cursor binds chats to the **absolute path** of the project directory. If you rename or move the directory, chats disappear from the sidebar (the data is still in Cursor's database, but it can't find them).

```bash
# You moved ~/projects/myapp → ~/work/myapp
# Chats are gone from the sidebar

# Close Cursor first (required — Cursor overwrites the sidebar DB on exit)
# Then in an external terminal:
cursaves move --from ~/projects/myapp --to ~/work/myapp

# Open Cursor — chats are back
```

`--to` defaults to the current directory, so from the new location you can just run:

```bash
cd ~/work/myapp
cursaves move --from ~/projects/myapp
```

The command finds chats from old workspace sidebars and from the global database (fallback), re-registers them in the target workspace, and removes them from old workspaces.

**Important:** `move` must be run while Cursor is **closed**. If Cursor is running, it will overwrite the sidebar database on exit and the moved chats will disappear again.

### SSH remote projects

When you connect to a remote server via Cursor's SSH feature, **chats are stored on your local machine**, not on the remote server. This means:

- `cursaves` must run **locally** (not on the remote server)
- SSH workspace paths like `/home/user/repos/myapp` don't exist on your local filesystem
- You can't just `cd` into them and run `cursaves push`

**Pushing from SSH workspaces:**

```bash
# Interactive selection (recommended)
cursaves push -s
#  → Shows all workspaces (local + SSH), lets you pick which chats to push

# Or by workspace number
cursaves workspaces          # List workspaces and find the number
cursaves push -w 3           # Push from workspace #3
```

**Pulling into SSH workspaces:**

```bash
# Interactive selection (recommended)
cursaves pull -s
#  → Shows available snapshots by project
#  → Auto-detects matching SSH workspaces
#  → Imports into the correct workspace

# Or by workspace number
cursaves workspaces          # List workspaces and find the number
cursaves pull -w 3           # Pull into workspace #3
```

**Important:** Run these commands in a **local terminal**, not in Cursor's integrated terminal (which runs on the remote server).

**After importing:** Restart Cursor (quit and reopen) to see the chats in your SSH session.

### Automatic sync

```bash
# Run on each machine -- handles everything in the background:
cursaves watch -p /path/to/your/project
```

The daemon handles checkpoint + git push/pull automatically. When you switch machines, conversations are already synced.

## Architecture

```
~/.cursaves/                   # Sync repo (git, private remote)
  snapshots/
    github.com-user-repo/      # Identified by git remote URL
      <composer-id>.json       # Self-contained conversation snapshot

~/.local/bin/cursaves          # Global CLI tool (installed via uv)

cursaves/                      # Source repo (this repo, public)
  cursor_saves/                # Python package
  docs/
  pyproject.toml
  LICENSE
```

The tool code (this repo) is separate from your conversation data (`~/.cursaves/`). Install the tool once, point it at a private remote, and sync from any project directory.

## Changelog (fork)

### v0.6.0

**New: `cursaves move` command**
- Re-register chats in a new workspace after renaming/moving a project directory
- Finds chats from both workspace sidebars and global DB (fallback)
- Blocks execution when Cursor is running (changes would be overwritten)

**Bug fixes:**
- **`.code-workspace` support**: `find_workspace_dirs_for_project` and `list_all_workspaces` now match workspaces opened via `.code-workspace` files (previously only `folder` URIs were matched)
- **Tilde expansion**: Workspace URIs containing `~` (e.g. `file://~/projects/foo`) are now resolved correctly via `expanduser`
- **"identical" skip registration**: When importing a chat that already exists in the global DB ("already up to date"), the workspace sidebar registration is now performed anyway. Previously the chat was silently skipped, leaving it invisible in the sidebar
- **`is_cursor_running()` on Linux**: The process is named `cursor` (lowercase) on Linux AppImage installs; previously only checked for `Cursor` (macOS)
- **`find_or_create_workspace`**: Uses `expanduser` when creating new workspace URIs

**Refactoring:**
- Extracted `_extract_path_from_uri()` — shared URI parsing for `file://`, `vscode-remote://`, tilde expansion
- Extracted `_ensure_workspace_registration()` — ensures sidebar registration on "identical"/"local_ahead" imports
- Removed duplicated workspace registration code from `import_snapshot` — now uses shared `_register_in_workspace`

## Contributing

**Version bumps are required on every commit.** Users install via `uv tool install git+...` and update with `uv tool upgrade cursaves`. The upgrade command compares version numbers -- if the version doesn't change, it won't pull new code even with new commits.

Bump the version in **both** files:
- `pyproject.toml` (`version = "X.Y.Z"`)
- `cursor_saves/__init__.py` (`__version__ = "X.Y.Z"`)

Use [semver](https://semver.org/): patch for fixes, minor for features, major for breaking changes.
